# Overview

In this software, I'm creating a to-do list app to keep track of my activities during the day

I created an app using C# with some frameworks to make it dynamic

The purpose is to keep track of my daily activities because sometimes you have too many activities and you can lose track
for some of them

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio for Mac 2022

I created the app using C#

# Useful Websites

- [Microsoft C# Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/dotnet/csharp/)
- [Dotnet C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp)

# Future Work

- Improve the UX by creating other options the user can implement with the to-do list app
- Create a favorite task section to let the user select favorite activities like running or going to the gym. Something that the user does daily
